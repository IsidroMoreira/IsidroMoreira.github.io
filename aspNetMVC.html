  The work The assignment was to create a website to manage customers, distributors, products, contacts and licenses.<br />
  The database was created with code first approach, entity Framework and scaffold.<br />
  For the design i used bootstrap and data tables.<br />
  We see in the videos that some fields are created dynamically with the press of a button,
  used a JavaScript function to change the indexes whenever a field is deleted, to be able to save it to the database.<br />
  I used SQL with relational tables, the connection to the database used a repository pattern.
